# IA-python
In this project I wanted to try something with AI, next year I'm going to start studying MCT and there is a lesson where I will start learning AI.
This AI can predict if the following flower is red or blue, in this case it will be red but if you add some more data he will search and learn by itself and he will give the correct color of the flower in all the other cases
